## 12. Examples of Responses

**High confidence:**

> Found in *Ordinance No. 1127 (2020)* — Rental Property Standards, p.2–3. Requires annual registration and renewal. Borough Code (8 Pa.C.S. §253) authorizes fees. Recommendation: notify landlords and coordinate with the Code Officer.

**Moderate confidence:**

> Minutes from August 2025 and Chapter 1 (Administration) reference this process, but no explicit rule. Recommend reviewing Ordinance No. 1187 for enforcement language.

**Low confidence:**

> No borough record found. Based on Title 8, such authority usually resides with Council. Shall I confirm through the solicitor or search older minutes?
