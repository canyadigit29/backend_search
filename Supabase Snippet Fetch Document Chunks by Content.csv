We have a quorum. Corrections to Meeting Minutes: Mrs. Charity Colebank correction on the back page. It stated that Caden Capetti signed checks for the fire department in a conflict of interest. There's a letter here from Nate Savanick, which is the Scottdale Volunteer Fire Department president.

Seconded by Caden. All in favor, none opposed. Motion carried. President Stansak explained rules to Isaac for his role as Junior Council. Contacting Borough Staff: An admin phone through First Net is being requested for administrative purposes, so the Borough Manager does not have to give out a personal cell number. The phone is free and the discount through First Net would increase the bill by no more than $45.99. Motion made by Mickey. Seconded by Caden. All in favor, none opposed, motion carried. Proposed budget for 2025: Borough Manager Stacey Coffman went through the budget for FY 2025 and EOY 2024. Looking towards 2025, with the use of the CD money and Money Market accounts the proposed budget will balance with some minor adjustments. The EOY 2024, is going to fall short and will need to utilize money from the savings and money market accounts in order to cover the deficit that is coming for the end of the year. SCCIA lease needs discussed. They have not been paying due to a contract not being created. Stacey Coffman stated she drew up a contract and sent it to ---PAGE 2--- SCCIA at the end of last month and their board is reviewing the contract. The solicitor recommended that they pay for the last 18 months even though there was no contract. The new contract is at $500 a month for rent with the request of airflow on that side of the building. The salaries for the office staff need to be figured out for the next year. The office copy machine needs to be replaced. Ford Technology Group can replace the printer and it's a five-year lease. After the five-year lease they will bring us a new machine. They have IT services that would lower license costs and assist offices with cloud services, visual, and quickbooks. ARPA money is allocated for a police interrogation room. Approximately 100k is allocated as grant matches that will need to come out of saved funds. Police costs increased this year. The vests will need to be replaced. There is a police grant that will cover 50% of the costs of the vests after purchase. Chief Pritts is willing to come back and do firearms certifications for the first couple years of his retirement, maintaining the cost of $100 each time. The fire department needs to have line items itemized moving forward. There’s a need for infant swings at the parks. The total cost is $3000. Grants may be able to cover this cost. The EOY cost is over $106k. Recommendation closing the savings account and moving the $5k into the general fund. The rest of the deficit can be offset by moving money from the money market and the CD. With Chief Pritts retirement and just the cops, the police expenses that we're looking at for the end of the year, we're looking at close to $100,000 for the end of year. The gazebo parklet has to have the permeable pavement pressure washed and then suctioned. The cost for that is roughly $4,800. And that's something that needs done every year or every couple of years. There is no projected tax increase for the FY 2025 as long as an interfund transfer happens with the CD and Money Market account. Solicitor recommended charging SCCIA the $400 for 18 months back rent even though a lease was never signed.

He was contacted by an attorney from Greensburg requesting a public hearing before council on a liquor relations transfer into Greystone Manor. Under the Liquor Code, you have to schedule a hearing in front of council, and it has to be advertised. 6 or 6.15 p.m. before the next meeting in December. Mayor's report: Not present. Public comment period: D. Petonic questioned the WSC proceedings and to have the Council recognize our veterans from World War I who served and who passed away on November 11th. ---PAGE 6--- Mary Yeager- Has a donor who wants to pay for materials and labor to fix up the Gazebo. Asking the council for permission to be able to get the work done. There is Steve Hall, Mark Wilson, and Solomon Painting. So they're all reputable local contractors that I'm getting these quotes from. Preferably it will be done before the end of the year, but with the weather it's not looking likely. If it is done before the end of the year, the Christmas lights would have to come on. The recommendation is to try to plan for spring. Stephanie Schropp- Bricks falling from the walls at the WSC outside of the fence area. Steve Eby will look into the costs to expand the fence to include the areas that are now falling.

Solicitor Falatovich explained that the past practice has been only property owners or business owners of the Borough can speak. Michelle Williams asked Solicitor Falatovich to explain what the free and clear sale is regarding the publishing house. Mrs. Williams also mentioned panhandling and trespassing.

Engineer Eby stated that most meetings he attends last two (2) hours. The Borough Council meetings last five (5) hours. He requested that he be allowed to attend for two (2) hours.

Solicitor Falatovich stated that Council can suspend the rules to get the Engineer in and out. Mrs. Colebank stated that Engineer Eby could answer questions by phone on his way home. • Moved by Mrs. Colebank, second by Mr. Siwula to accept Widmer's 2020 fees. Motion passed. Mr. Davis discussed his concerns over the Sewage Authority. Why did the DEP approve a larger capacity plan but we are now over capacity? Engineer Eby explained that the DEP mandate is to contain 85% of stormwater. The original study had more volume. Engineer Eby did not do the study. If the perimeter outfalls are taken out of the equation and one (1) large rainfall is removed, the Borough may make the 85%. He is working on the calculations so that the Borough does not have to separate the stormwater from the sanitary sewers. The Sewage Authority needs to sit down with each municipality and figure out what happens when they take o~er the lines and define the agreement. Moved by Mr. Davis, second by Mr. Close to suspend the rules. Motion passed. ENGINEER'S REPORT - Engineer Eby reported that some elevations of the outfalls isn't allowing everything to go into the interceptor. It is going into Jacobs Creek.

This property has been owned by the family since 1890. A fire damaged the building and it was torn down. The Fagan family maintains the property. Duraloy has always had access.

From: Stephanie Sent: Monday, September 11, 2023 3:56 PM To: Angelo Pallone; Gary Falatovich Subject: Agenda Hello, Unfortunately I'm not able to make it to the meeting tonight because I'm sick. I am on the agenda . I just wanted to let you know that I will not be present . However, I do want to thank Dave Wendell and the fire department for taking the time out of there busy schedules to check out the former MPH since the last council meeting. Also, per Tim Burkhart, Project Manager for Diamond Communications (towers), AT&T wants the towers moved to a different location due the instability of the building. He and another gentleman were on site since the last meeting and I spoke to them briefly. Are there any updates regarding the towers being moved to a safer location? He also pointed out and seemed surprised that the 600 block of Walnut Ave was not blocked off to traffic due to safety concerns and structural damage to the building. His concern was focused mainly on the roof. This reminded me to follow up with a question that I asked a few months ago. Who deemed the building safe again after the brick fell in February of 2020? Since then more brick has slowly fallen from the building and a window fell from the top level and shattered on the Walnut Avenue The police responded to the window incident. I'm hoping that my questions are answered during tontg_ht's public meeting. 1 Thank you, Stephanie Schropp ---PAGE 2--- Solicitor Falatovich reported that he reached out to the Redevelopment Authority and the Land Bank.

This will probably be the most effective solution. Common sense tells me that the signs should be moved by the Department of Public Works. Please act like adults instead of squabbling like little children. Listen to a recording of yourselves arguing over who is going to move the radar signs. While I would like very much for this one to remain where it is now, there are many other residents that would like to have the traffic slow down like it has on my street. I did look back through the minutes (thank you so much Amy for making them available!) but could not find any references as to who would be responsible for moving the signs. The August agenda Action Item number 4. c noted Radarsigns Placement Procedure but I don't think it was resolved. I will see you all at next month's meeting!
